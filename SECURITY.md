# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please do not open public issues for security problems.

Report vulnerabilities privately by contacting project maintainers and include:
- A clear description of the issue
- Steps to reproduce
- Potential impact
- Suggested remediation (if available)

We will acknowledge reports as soon as possible and work on a fix.
